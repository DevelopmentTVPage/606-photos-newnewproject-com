    "description": "Loving this Pro Pencil by Anastasia! It highlights your brow bone perfectly and is also great to use as a primer and even can be used as a concealer. Pro Pencil does the work of 5 makeup bag must-haves in one portable pencil.\nBrightens complexion, cover flaws, and masks dark circles.\nCreates the perfect brow accessory to carve out perfectly precise brows.\nLines lips.\nActs as a perfect eye shadow base.\nHighlights the brows, face, and eyes.\n\n I've been using it everyday since I purchased it.  It is a game changer! I am using color: Base 1. Highly recommend, 5 out of 5 stars!  Also wearing eyeshadow from my fav Naked 3 palette.",
