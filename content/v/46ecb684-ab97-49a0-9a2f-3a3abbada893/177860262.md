    "description": "Hi Everyone!\nI am so excited to share my video with you today because..\n1. I was able to film with one of my fellow Style Crew ambassador, Michelle, talking all about perfect Fall pieces and how we style during the transitional months.\n2. Michelle and I were handpicked to try a few pieces from the limited-edition Zoe by Rachel Zoe Fall capsule collection. Rachel Zoe is a beautiful designer and her new collection shows off her amazing talent. The collection is full of glamorous pieces with a touch of femme adding gold accents, ruffles, and luxe prints. I hope you find pieces you love and happy shopping!\n\nAll Web IDs are below searchable on macys.com\nFringe Jacket: 6583153\nDKNY Shoes:\nCream Mock-Neck Top: 6510620\nTweed Dress: 6537976",
