    "description": "I've been struggling with finding a mascara that doesn't smudge...turns out I just needed a good setting powder.  I am in LOVE with this Nars Light Reflecting Powder.  It's so silky and smooth and actually makes my eyes look less tired.  What?!  IKR! \nI'm also a believer in waterproof mascara for these really hot & humid days we've been having and my fav is Lancome's Monsieur Big.",
