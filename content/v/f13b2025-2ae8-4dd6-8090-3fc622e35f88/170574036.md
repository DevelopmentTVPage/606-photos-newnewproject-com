One of the first products I had tried was their concealer and the next thing I know- I found myself in love with what they have to offer. If you have not yet tried their products- my favorites are added to the link and I highly recommend you go for it ! I am also wearing a new Free People Jacket that just arrived for fall. Can I just say Yaasssss!!!  Thank you guys for watching and keep a look out for my next upcoming video !",
