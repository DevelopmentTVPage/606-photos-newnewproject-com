    "description": "Face Tanner: I have been using Clarins Radiance-Plus Glow Booster on my face for a couple of weeks and I am in LOVE!  I never like to use the sunless tanner I use on my body on my face because my skin is sensitive and they always seem to break me out.  This booster is made for your face and I love how easy it is to use.  You just mix a few drops with your moisturizer.  You can use it day and night and use can decide how many drops you want to use. Very customizable! \nBody Tanner: I recently switched to St. Tropez Express tanner to use on my body.  Very happy with the results and it doesn't smell like most sunless tanners do!\nTop: Love these Under Armour mesh back tanks, bright colors are on SALE!",
