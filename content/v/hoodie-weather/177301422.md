    "description": "To be honest, I am not a fan of cooler weather.  I absolutely hate being cold.  I walked into my local Macy's and I had to have this hoodie.  It's available in 4 other colors and I want them all.  I love that is Adidas but the logo is small and the stripes are under.  Makes it unique!  Runs TTS, however I sized up to a small for a loose fit.  My Adidas sneakers are still on SALE too.",
