    "description": "I move to feel great, not to lose weight and some of the best pieces I have found have been from the Nike plus size line. From casual pieces to hang out in on the weekends, to items I can wear doing my cardio and stretching all the way to pieces that have a lot of true performance touches I really can find everything I need to get moving at Macy's. Here I am wearing a 2X in all pieces and they fit true to size.",
