    "description": "I have found my favorite pair of pants and I am so excited to share with you how I style them and why I am obsessed with these Bar III striped split pant (now that is a mouthful). I struggle finding any bottoms to fit me due to being a petite customer and very self-conscious with fit. This pant is flowy, light weight, and has a slit on the leg for a little bit of sass. I love having a piece of clothing that makes me feel sexy and confident and I hope you enjoy these pants as much as I do. \nThanks for watching!",
